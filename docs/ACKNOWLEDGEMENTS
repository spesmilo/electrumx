Thanks to Thomas Voegtlin for creating the Electrum software and
infrastructure and for maintaining it so diligently.  Electrum is
probably the best desktop Bitcoin wallet solution for most users.  My
faith in it is such that I use Electrum software to store most of my
Bitcoin.

Whilst the vast majority of the code here is my own original work and
includes some new ideas, it is very clear that the general structure
and concept are those of Electrum.  Some parts of the code and ideas
of Electrum, some of which it itself took from other projects such as
Abe and pywallet, remain.  Thanks to the authors of all the software
this is derived from.

I'd like to thank bauerj, hsmiths and JWU42 of #electrum for their
help and support in testing the versions of ElectrumX prior to 1.0.

Thanks to Daniel Bernstein for daemontools and other software, and to
Matthew Dillon for DragonFlyBSD.  They are both deeply inspirational
people.

And of course, thanks to Satoshi for the wonderful creation that is
Bitcoin.
